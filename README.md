🚀 **Author:** Rihanna

## Project Overview

This project combines two useful tools into one interactive application:

1. **Days Calendar** – Displays special commemorative days dynamically.
2. **Spaced Repetition Tracker** – Helps users track study topics with scheduled revisions.  
3. **Weather Display (Future API Integration)** – Currently shows static weather data, to be upgraded with live API support.

The goal is to provide an interactive calendar and study tool that keeps users informed about commemorative days, study schedules, and the weather—all in one interface.
